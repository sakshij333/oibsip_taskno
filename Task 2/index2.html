            <b>Marie Salomea Skłodowska–Curie</b> (7 November 1867 – 4 July 1934) was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist 
             and chemist who conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize, the 
             first person and the only woman to win a Nobel Prize twice, and the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific
             fields. Her husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making them the first-ever married couple
             to win the Nobel Prize and launching the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the first woman 
             to become a professor at the University of Paris.
             She was born in Warsaw, in what was then the Kingdom of Poland, part of the Russian Empire. She studied at Warsaw's 
             clandestine Flying University and began her practical scientific training in Warsaw. In 1891, aged 24, she followed 
             her elder sister Bronisława to study in Paris, where she earned her higher degrees and conducted her subsequent
             scientific work. In 1895 she married the French physicist Pierre Curie, and she shared the 1903 Nobel Prize in Physics
             with him and with the physicist Henri Becquerel for their pioneering work developing the theory of "radioactivity"—a 
             term she coined.In 1906 Pierre Curie died in a Paris street accident. Marie won the 1911 Nobel Prize in Chemistry
             for her discovery of the elements polonium and radium, using techniques she invented for isolating radioactive isotopes.
